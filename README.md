# mvvm-template
A template for quickly building a project that implements MVVM architecture using ViewModel,  Room, Dagger2, Data Binding, WorkManager, Navigation.

## Requirement:
* Android Studio 3.3+
* Kotlin / [Java](https://github.com/my-jabin/mvvm-template/tree/java)

## Architecture
* Single-Activity-Multiple-Fragments

* MVVM architecture

![](images/mvvm-architecture.png)

## How to use it
1. Add/Modify the entities class. In the template, there is only a `Product` entity. Add your own entity. Then create a corresponding `Dao` and `Repository` class, add `Dao` to `AppDatabase` class.
2. Dependency injection:
    * Your activities need to be added in the `ActivityBuilder` class.
    * Your `ViewModel` class need to be added in the `ViewModelModule` class.
    * If any application associated dependencies is required, could be provided in the `AppModule` class
    * Any activity/fragment associated dependencies could be provided in the `xxxActivityModule` class or `xxxFragmentModule`
    * Binds your own `Worker` in the `WorkerBindingModule`, do not forget the Factory interface, see the example class `PrePopulateDataWorker`.
3. In this template, single-activity-multiple-fragments architecture is using in the whole project. If you use the same architecture, add your fragment in the `MainActivityModule` and create your `xxxFragmentModule`
4. Change the UI components.
5. Navigation graph:
  * Start destination is the `MainFragment`
  * One global action to `SettingFragment`

## Dagger 2
* `@Inject`: Basically with this annotation we request dependencies. In other words, you use it to tell Dagger that the annotated class or field wants to participate in dependency injection. Thus, Dagger will construct instances of this annotated classes and satisfy their dependencies.

* `@Module`: Modules are classes whose methods provide dependencies, so we define a class and annotate it with @Module, thus, Dagger will know where to find the dependencies in order to satisfy them when constructing class instances. One important feature of modules is that they have been designed to be partitioned and composed together (for instance we will see that in our apps we can have multiple composed modules).

* `@Provide`: Inside modules we define methods containing this annotation which tells Dagger how we want to construct and provide those mentioned dependencies.

* `@Component`: Components basically are injectors, let’s say a bridge between @Inject and @Module, which its main responsibility is to put both together. They just give you instances of all the types you defined, for example, we must annotate an interface with @Component and list all the @Modules that will compose that component, and if any of them is missing, we get errors at compile time. All the components are aware of the scope of dependencies it provides through its modules.

* `@Scope`: Scopes are very useful and Dagger 2 has has a more concrete way to do scoping through custom annotations. We will see an example later, but this is a very powerful feature, because as pointed out earlier, there is no need that every object knows about how to manage its own instances. An scope example would be a class with a custom @PerActivity annotation, so this object will live as long as our Activity is alive. In other words, we can define the granularity of your scopes (@PerFragment, @PerUser, etc).

* `@Qualifier`: We use this annotation when the type of class is insufficient to identify a dependency. For example in the case of Android, many times we need different types of context, so we might define a qualifier annotation @ForApplication and @ForActivity, thus when injecting a context we can use those qualifiers to tell Dagger which type of context we want to be provided.

In the `AppComponent` class
``` kotlin
@Singleton
@Component(modules = [
    AndroidSupportInjectionModule::class,
    WorkerAssistedInjectModule::class,
    AppModule::class,
    ActivityBuilder::class])
interface AppComponent : AndroidInjector<MvvmApp> {

    @Component.Builder
    abstract class Builder : AndroidInjector.Builder<MvvmApp>()

}
```

* `AndroidSupportInjectionModule`. is just an alias of `AndroidInjectionModule` which is descripted according to official document as
 ```
/**
 * Contains bindings to ensure the usability of {@code dagger.android} framework classes. This
 * module should be installed in the component that is used to inject the {@link
 * android.app.Application} class.
 */
```

* `ActivityBuilder` class is a customized module. We map all activities here, tell Dagger all of our activities in compile time

* `AppModule` class provides global dependencies. Like retrofit, okhttp, persitence db etc.

#### Map Multibindings

Dagger lets you use multibindings to contribute entries to an injectable map as long as the map keys are known at compile time.

To contribute an entry to a multibound map, add a method to a module that returns the value and is annotated with @IntoMap and with another custom annotation that specifies the map key for that entry.
``` kotlin
@Module
abstract class ViewModelModule {

     @Binds
     @IntoMap
     @ViewModelKey(MainActivityViewModel::class)
     abstract fun bindsMainActivityViewModel(viewModel: MainActivityViewModel): ViewModel

     @Binds
     @IntoMap
     @ViewModelKey(MainFragViewModel::class)
     abstract fun bindsMainFragViewModel(viewModel: MainFragViewModel): ViewModel
}
```
In the above example, two `ViewModel` are added into a map with the structure `(Map<K, Provider<V>>).`, where key is a customized key annotated with `@ViewModelKey`, valus is a `Provider`

``` kotlin
@kotlin.annotation.Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
@MapKey
annotation class ViewModelKey(val value: KClass<out ViewModel>)
```

Annotation `@Binds` is similar to `@Provides`. Simply put, the difference is `@Provides` return a concrete instance, while `@Binds` return an interface

---

#### Annotation `@ContributesAndroidInjector`
Dagger Android introduced an annotation which can reduce the `Component` `Binds` `IntoSet` `Subcomponent` `ActivityKey` `FragmentKey` etc. boilerplate for you.
``` kotlin
@Module
abstract class ActivityBuilder {

    @ContributesAndroidInjector(modules = [MainActivityModule::class])
    abstract fun bindsMainActivity(): MainActivity

}

```

`ActivityBuilder` tells Dagger all activities in the compile time. Using `@ContributesAndroidInjector`, Dagger generates automatically the following code for us.

``` java
@Module(subcomponents = ActivityBuilder_BindsMainActivity.MainActivitySubcomponent.class)
public abstract class ActivityBuilder_BindsMainActivity {
  private ActivityBuilder_BindsMainActivity() {}

  @Binds
  @IntoMap
  @ClassKey(MainActivity.class)
  abstract AndroidInjector.Factory<?> bindAndroidInjectorFactory(
      MainActivitySubcomponent.Builder builder);

  @Subcomponent(modules = MainActivityModule.class)
  public interface MainActivitySubcomponent extends AndroidInjector<MainActivity> {
    @Subcomponent.Builder
    abstract class Builder extends AndroidInjector.Builder<MainActivity> {}
  }
}
```

#### How to perform constructor injection in the `androidx.work.Worker`
**Problem**:
``` java
public class PrePopulateDataWorker extends Worker {
   public PrePopulateDataWorker(@NonNull Context context,@NonNull WorkerParameters workerParams) {
       super(context, workerParams);
   }
}
```
`Worker` are instantiated by `WorkerManager` (like Activity and Fragment are instantiated by Android framework) not by us. This means you can’t pass any other parameter as the dependencies in the constructor expect the `Context` and `WorkerParameters`, therefore, it is almost impossible to perform constructor injection on `Worker` class. This left out for us the only option is field injection. However, filed injection is not recommended. The best practice is to use constructor injection.

**Expectation**
We could perform constructor injection like below.
``` java
@Inject
public PrePopulateDataWorker(@NonNull Context context, @NonNull WorkerParameters workerParams, DataManager dataManager) {
    super(context, workerParams);
    this.dataManager = dataManager;
}
```

 In this template-project, we could perform constructor inject similar to the above code.
 ``` java
@AssistedInject
public PrePopulateDataWorker(@Assisted @NonNull Context context, @Assisted @NonNull WorkerParameters workerParams, DataManager dataManager) {
    super(context, workerParams);
    this.dataManager = dataManager;
}
 ```
 Here we inject the instance of `DataManger` to the constructor, the `Context` and `WorkerParameters` is provides by Android system.

**Solution**  
Solution is from this [blog post](https://medium.com/@nlg.tuan.kiet/dagger-2-setup-with-workmanager-a-complete-step-by-step-guild-bb9f474bde37).

**Explain**
`WorkManager` allows us to provide our own custom `WorkFactory` which is responsible for creating `ListenableWorker` instances. `WorkManager` needs to be initialized when the application starts, before you get an instance of the `WorkManager` singleton. Hence it should be called either during `Application.onCreate()` or in a `ContentProvider.onCreate()`.
> `Worker` is a subclass of `ListenableWorker`

``` kotlin
@Inject
lateinit var myWorkerFactory: WorkerFactory
override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()
    WorkManager.initialize(this, Configuration.Builder().setWorkerFactory(myWorkerFactory).build())
}
```
Instance `myWorkerFactory` is now responsible for creating `ListenableWorker` object.
How does `myWorkerFactory` create `ListenableWorker`?
``` kotlin
@Singleton
class MyWorkerFactory @Inject constructor(
        private val workerFactories: MutableMap<Class<out ListenableWorker>, Provider<CustomWorkerFactory>>
) : WorkerFactory() {

    override fun createWorker(appContext: Context, workerClassName: String, workerParameters: WorkerParameters): ListenableWorker? {
        var listenableWorker: ListenableWorker? = null
        try {
            var provider: Provider<out CustomWorkerFactory>? = null
            for ((key, value) in workerFactories) {
                if (Class.forName(workerClassName).isAssignableFrom(key)) {
                    provider = value
                    break
                }
            }
            if (provider == null) {
                throw IllegalArgumentException("unknown model class $workerClassName")
            }
            listenableWorker = provider.get().create(appContext, workerParameters)
        } catch (e: ClassNotFoundException) {
            e.printStackTrace()
        }

        return listenableWorker
    }
}
```
It gets `Worker` from a `Map` instance, here is `workerFactories`. This map has the structure:
* **Key**: Class< out ListenableWorker >
* **Value**: Provider< CustomWorkerFactory >

in the `createWorker` method, We search the map `workerFactories` based on the given `workerClassName` to find out a `CustomWorkerFactory` instance, this `CustomWorkerFactory` is able to create a `ListenableWorker` via method `create(Context context, WorkerParameters workerParams)`. After that, a `ListenableWorker` is created and returned.
 ``` kotlin
 interface CustomWorkerFactory {
     fun create(context: Context, workerParams: WorkerParameters): ListenableWorker
 }
 ```
**Question**: where does the `workerFactories` come from?
It's injected by dagger multibindings.
``` kotlin
@Module
abstract class WorkerBindingModule {

    @Binds
    @IntoMap
    @WorkerKey(PrePopulateDataWorker::class)
    abstract fun bindsPrePopulateDataWorker(factory: PrePopulateDataWorker.Factory): CustomWorkerFactory

    @Binds
    abstract fun bindsWorkerFactory(factory: MyWorkerFactory): WorkerFactory
}
```
We bind objects into a map. In this example, the map has one entry with
* **Key**: `PrePopulateDataWorker.class`. A subclass of `Worker`
* **Value**: `PrePopulateDataWorker.Factory` instance. It's a subtype of `CustomWorkerFactory`

Dagger helps us inject a instance of `PrePopulateDataWorker.Factory` automatically into the map in the runtime.

``` java
class PrePopulateDataWorker @AssistedInject constructor(
        @Assisted context: Context,
        @Assisted workerParams: WorkerParameters,
        private val dataManager: DataManager
) : CoroutineWorker(context, workerParams) {

    override val coroutineContext = Dispatchers.IO

    override suspend fun doWork(): Result {
        return coroutineScope {
            dataManager.prePopulateData()
            Result.success()
        }
    }

    @AssistedInject.Factory
    interface Factory : CustomWorkerFactory
}
```
**Question**: What is the implementation of the interface `PrePopulateDataWorker.Factory`?
Thanks to `AssistedInject`, check the generated code:
``` java
@Module
public abstract class AssistedInject_WorkerAssistedInjectModule {
  private AssistedInject_WorkerAssistedInjectModule() {
  }

  @Binds
  abstract PrePopulateDataWorker.Factory bind_com_jiujiu_mvvmTemplate_worker_PrePopulateDataWorker(
      PrePopulateDataWorker_AssistedFactory factory);
}
```
this abstract class is annotated with `@Module` which provides an implementation of `PrePopulateDataWorker.Factory`, the `PrePopulateDataWorker_AssistedFactory` instance which is also generated by `AssistedInject`

``` java
public final class PrePopulateDataWorker_AssistedFactory implements PrePopulateDataWorker.Factory {
  private final Provider<DataManager> dataManager;

  @Inject
  public PrePopulateDataWorker_AssistedFactory(Provider<DataManager> dataManager) {
    this.dataManager = dataManager;
  }

  @Override
  public ListenableWorker create(Context context, WorkerParameters workerParams) {
    return new PrePopulateDataWorker(
        context,
        workerParams,
        dataManager.get());
  }
}
```
In this class, the `DataManager` is injected!!! It also returns a `PrePopulateDataWorker` instance in the `create` method.

Go back to the dagger multibindings map, now we are much more clear what is inside of this map.  It has for now only one entry:
* **Key**: `PrePopulateDataWorker.class`. A subclass of `Worker`
* **Value**: `PrePopulateDataWorker_AssistedFactory` instance. It's a subtype of `CustomWorkerFactory`

When we want to enqueue a worker into the `WorkManager`, our `myWorkFactory` search the multibinding map and return the corresponding `Worker` for us.

``` kotlin
OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder(PrePopulateDataWorker::class.java).build().apply {
    WorkManager.getInstance().enqueue(this)
}
```

**Summary**
* Cannot control how `Worker` instance is instanced
=> register a custom `WorkerFactory` to `WorkerManager`
* Cannot perform constructor injection on `Worker` class
=> use factory pattern
* Do not want to implement those factories manually
=> use `AssistedInject`
